NodeAuth Debug (Docker + Cursor)

Prerequisites:
- Complete "LocalSslCertificateSetup.txt"
- Docker Desktop running
- Cursor launch config "Attach to NodeAuth (Docker)" in .vscode/launch.json

Start the stack:
1. Run: docker compose -f docker-compose-node.yml up
2. Wait for auth.web to report it is listening on port 8080

Attach the debugger:
1. In Cursor, open the Debug panel
2. Select "Attach to NodeAuth (Docker)"
3. Click Start Debugging
4. Set breakpoints in NodeAuth/src and hit an /api/auth endpoint

Troubleshooting:
- Inspector already in use: auth.web is launched via node directly in
  docker-compose-node.yml to avoid npm spawning a second inspector.
- Breakpoints not hit: confirm the container logs show
  "Debugger listening on ws://0.0.0.0:9229".
- Attach fails: verify docker-compose-node.yml maps "9229:9229"
  and NODE_OPTIONS includes --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229.
- Source paths wrong: localRoot should be ${workspaceFolder}/NodeAuth
  and remoteRoot should be /app in .vscode/launch.json.
- Requests not reaching auth.web: ensure nginx routes
  /api/auth/ to http://auth.web:8080 in nginx/config/routes.conf.
- No log changes after edits: this setup does not use hot reload; restart
  the container after code changes.
