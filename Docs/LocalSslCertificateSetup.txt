Create SSL certificate for development purposes
The below steps are for Windows, for a different OS you need to research on how you can achieve the below steps.

Prerequisites
- Openssl (it can be installed separately but is it found in the GIT install). 

Certificate creation
The Nginx configuration needs 2 files to run: 
[root]/nigix/ssl/self-signed.key (also .pem, but for .pem you also need to change nginx config files)
[root]/nigix/ssl/self-signed.crt (also .pem, but for .pem you also need to change nginx config files)


There are multiple ways to create a self-signed certificate under Windows, If you know another way to obtain the
files, skip to step 3 
We will use the openssl exe to create a self signed certificate for dev purposes. Openssl usually comes with Git. 
If it is not in the Git directories you can install it separately. Usually in Git openssl can be found under 
"c:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\" but the path can differ from one distribution to another.
 
Steps:
1). Create an empty directory called "ssl" under [root]/nigix where [root] is your local path to the repo
folder.
2). Run powershell (preferably as administrator)
3). check to see if there are local cerificates installed, usually there are. Excute:
Get-ChildItem -Path "cert:\LocalMachine\My"
If you do not see any certificate, please research on other method to create the two files for nginx
4). Run the following 

  $cert = Get-ChildItem -Path "cert:\LocalMachine\My" |
        Where-Object { $_.Subject -like "*CN=localhost*" } |
        Sort-Object NotBefore -Descending |
        Select-Object -First 1
(this gets in the $cert variable the first certificate for localhost)

then:
$pwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "certpassword" -Force -AsPlainText
(sets "certpassword" as password)

then (replace [root] with your local path:
Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $cert -FilePath "[root]\nginx\ssl\self-signed.pfx" -Password $pwd

(the file self-signed.pfx appears in the directory)

5). (optional) Make sure the cerificate is trusted:
    $store = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store "Root", "LocalMachine"
    $store.Open("ReadWrite")
    $store.Add($cert)
    $store.Close()

6). Extract the key
- point powershell to the openssl.exe directory
 cd "c:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin"
- extract the key, it will ask for the password, enter "certpassword"
.\openssl pkcs12 -in "[root]\nginx\ssl\self-signed.pfx" -nocerts -out "[root]\nginx\ssl\self-signed.key" -nodes
(the file self-signed.key appears)

7) extract the crt
.\openssl pkcs12 -in "[root]\nginx\ssl\self-signed.pfx" -clcerts -nokeys -out "[root]\nginx\ssl\self-signed.crt"
(the file self-signed.crt appears)
